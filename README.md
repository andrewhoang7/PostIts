# Description
"PostIts" is an iOS application, written entirely in Swift, that works with Google’s Firebase Firestore as well as Firebase Authentication to store “posts” that a user can create, view, and delete. 

Some implemented features include search, the ability to “favorite” a post, and a separate tab to view posts that have been “favorited”. 

This app was written with an MVVM architecture and with best practices kept in mind, such as creating directories for “supporting views”, generic implementations where possible, Swift’s data-binding features for more loosely coupled code, creating previews for capturing all different states that might occur in a view within Xcode, and using async/await syntax for cleaner networking code in making requests.
