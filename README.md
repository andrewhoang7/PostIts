# Description
"PostIts" is an iOS application, written entirely in Swift, that works with Google’s Firebase Firestore as well as Firebase Authentication to store “posts” that a user can create, view, and delete. 

Some implemented features include search, the ability to “favorite” a post, and a separate tab to view posts that have been “favorited”.
